2.2 About Dataset
The Twitter Sentiment Dataset is available on Analytics Vidhyaâ€™s practice problem. The
objective of this dataset is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a
tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, it classifies
the racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Dataset Details:
a) Size: It is a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets, making it suitable for analysis.
b) Textual Content: Each tweet in the dataset is accompanied by the corresponding
sentiment label, indicating whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
c) Distribution: The dataset exhibits a balanced distribution of positive and negative
sentiments, ensuring that models trained on it can effectively learn from both
perspectives.

Dataset Structure:

The dataset comprises of three columns:
a) Id: It shows the id of the user who made the tweet.
b) Label: There are two labels (0, 1) and each tweet is associated with atleast one label,
where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not
racist/sexist.
c) Tweet: There are total of 31,962 tweets. It contains the tweets that are made by the
people.
